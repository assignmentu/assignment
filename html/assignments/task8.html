<h3 id="CPU">CPU</h3>
<p>CPU (pronounced as separate letters) is the abbreviation for central processing unit. Sometimes referred to simply as the central processor, but more commonly called processor, the CPU is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place.</p><br><br><br>
<h3 id="ALU">ALU</h3>
<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer.</p><br><br><br>
<h2 id="Programming">Programming Languages</h2><br>
<h3 id="C">C</h3>
<p>C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs.</p><br><br><br>
<h3 id="Cpp">CPP</h3>
<p>C++ is an object oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style."</p><br><br><br>
